#You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of the ith item in a shop.
# There is a special discount for items in the shop. If you buy the ith item,
#  then you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[j] where j is the minimum index such that j > i and prices[j] <= prices[i].
#  Otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.
# Return an integer array answer where answer[i] is the final price you will pay for the ith item of the shop,
# considering the special discount.
